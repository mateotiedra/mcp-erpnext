## Available Operations (Generic)

The `operations.ts` tools provide generic CRUD for any ERPNext DocType:

| Operation  | Tool                 | Notes                                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Update** | `erpnext_doc_update` | Partial patch — pass only fields to change              |
| **Delete** | `erpnext_doc_delete` | Draft documents only; submitted must be cancelled first |
| **Submit** | `erpnext_doc_submit` | Calls `frappe.client.submit`                            |
| **Cancel** | `erpnext_doc_cancel` | Calls `frappe.client.cancel`                            |
| **Get**    | `erpnext_doc_get`    | For DocTypes without a dedicated `_get` tool            |
| **List**   | `erpnext_doc_list`   | Full control: fields, filters, limit, order_by          |

Specific DocTypes also have dedicated submit/cancel tools:
`erpnext_sales_order_submit/cancel`, `erpnext_sales_invoice_submit`.

> **Note**: All submit handlers fetch the doc first (`GET`) to pass `modified`
> for optimistic locking. See `docs/known-issues.md` for details.

## Design Decisions

1. **Purchase tools in `purchasing` category** — PO/PI tools live in
   `purchasing.ts` alongside suppliers, receipts, and quotations.
   `accounting.ts` focuses on accounts, journal entries, and payment entries.

2. **`erpnext_doc_*` as escape hatch** — The 6 generic operations tools cover
   any DocType not yet wrapped. They are the recommended approach for one-off
   operations rather than adding more typed tools.

3. **`_get` tools have no `_meta.ui`** — Only `sales_invoice_get` uses
   `invoice-viewer`. Other `_get` tools return raw JSON. Typed viewers for
   individual documents (customer detail, asset detail, etc.) remain a future
   improvement.

4. **Expense Claim child table pattern** — `erpnext_expense_claim_create`
   demonstrates the pattern for child tables via `expenses[]` array, reusable
   for BOM items, timesheet logs, etc.

5. **Leave balance via Leave Allocation** — `erpnext_leave_balance` reads
   `Leave Allocation` (docstatus=1) directly, which is simpler than calling the
   `get_leave_balance_on` method but may not reflect leave taken within the
   allocation period.

## Production Hardening (TODO avant usage réel)

> Voir aussi `docs/known-issues.md` pour les bugs connus et fixes appliqués.

La lib fonctionne pour du prototypage/dev. Avant de brancher sur un vrai ERPNext
:

| Priorité | Quoi                                                            | Pourquoi                                                                                                                | Effort           |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **P0**   | Créer un user ERPNext dédié avec rôles restreints               | Un seul API key/secret = un seul contexte user. Si c'est admin, le LLM peut tout lire/modifier/supprimer                | Config ERPNext   |
| **P0**   | Env var `ERPNEXT_COMPANY` injectée dans tous les creates        | ERPNext est multi-company. Sans ça, les creates utilisent la company par défaut du user API — implicite et non contrôlé | ~1h              |
| **P1**   | Flag `ERPNEXT_READONLY=true` qui désactive les tools d'écriture | Empêche les create/update/delete/submit/cancel quand on veut juste de la lecture                                        | ~30min           |
| **P1**   | `_meta.requiresApproval: true` sur les tools destructifs        | Le host MCP peut demander confirmation avant delete/submit/cancel                                                       | ~2h              |
| **P2**   | Header `X-MCP-Agent` pour tracer la source des modifications    | ERPNext logge tout sous le user API — impossible de distinguer humain vs IA                                             | Dépend de Frappe |

### Risques connus

- **Pas de multi-utilisateur** — Tous les clients MCP partagent le même user
  ERPNext
- **`erpnext_doc_delete` / `erpnext_doc_update` sans garde-fou** — Seules les
  permissions ERPNext du user API protègent
- **Pas de scoping Company** — Certains tools ont un filtre `company`, la
  plupart non
- **Pas de traçabilité MCP** — Les modifications sont attribuées au user API,
  pas à l'agent qui les a faites
